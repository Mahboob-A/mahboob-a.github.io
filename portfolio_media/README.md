## Placeholder Images

Until you can replace these with actual screenshots and photos, you can use placeholder services like:

- https://placeholder.com/ (e.g., `https://via.placeholder.com/600x338?text=Algocode+Architecture`)
- https://picsum.photos/ for random images (e.g., `https://picsum.photos/600/338`)
